**Favorites Toolbar Customization – Personalize Your Home Menu**

---

## **📄 Description**

  

The **Home** tab is the primary workspace in RcloneView and currently includes:

  

> 🔁 Sync | 🔄 Compare | 📋 Job Manager | 🪟 New Window

  

However, some users prefer quicker access to tools like:

- ➕ New Remote
    
- 🌐 Mount Manager
    
- ⚙️ General Settings
    

  

This feature will introduce a **simple favorites system** that lets users:

- ⭐ **Add any button** from other tabs (Remote, Settings, Help) to the **Home Toolbar**
    
- ❌ **Remove default buttons** they don’t use
    
- 💾 **Save a custom Home layout** to match personal workflows
    

  

No drag-and-drop or full layout editor — just click “Add to Home” or “Remove from Home” per tool.

## **🛠️ Usage Scenarios**

  

### **Example 1: Remote Power User**

  

Alice frequently mounts remotes and manages cloud connections.

She customizes her Home tab to show:

  

> ➕ New Remote | ☁️ Mount Manager | 📋 Job Manager

  

### **Example 2: Settings-Focused Admin**

  

Bob maintains sync policy settings across multiple users.

His Home tab looks like:

  

> ⚙️ General Settings | 🗂️ View Count | 📋 Job Manager

  

This keeps high-usage actions just **one click away**, from the first screen.

## **⚠️ Limitations to Overcome**

| **Issue**                                       | **Solution Proposal**                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Accidental misconfiguration could confuse users | Provide “Reset to Default” button in Layout settings |

## **📅 Roadmap (Vision)**

- ✅ Add/remove toolbar buttons via right-click or settings panel
    
- ⏳ Support up to 6 Home buttons (layout-aware)
     
- 🧹 Include “Reset to Default” fallback
