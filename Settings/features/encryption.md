## **🧩 Title**

  

**Simplify and Improve Crypt Remote Setup in RcloneView**

---

## **📄 Description**

  

Rclone offers powerful encryption through the **Crypt remote**, allowing users to:

- 🔒 Encrypt file names, directory structures, and contents
    
- 🧳 Store secure backups in public or private cloud providers
    
- 🔑 Maintain confidentiality without relying on third-party apps
    

  

In RcloneView, we aim to **simplify** this complex setup for end users by:

  

> ✅ Wrapping crypt: remotes as **Alias-based overlays**,

> ✅ Allowing intuitive remote selection (e.g., “Encrypt on top of Dropbox: /Secure”)

> ✅ Providing visual UI to input password / salt / obscured keys safely

## **✨ Planned Improvements**

  

We are exploring several ideas to make Crypt easier and safer for non-technical users:

| **Proposed Improvement**     | **Description**                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 **Auto-alias generation** | Let users pick a target remote + folder path; generate crypt alias automatically |
| 🧼 **UI validation**         | Warn users when password/salt is empty or insecure                               |
